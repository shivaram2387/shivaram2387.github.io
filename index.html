            <h3>Synthetika IO</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Co-founder</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> September 2021 – Present</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> A synthetic availability monitoring and alerting service built on AWS. Synthetika allows users to monitor their website or app by simulating user journeys in the same web browsers that their customers use. Any business with an online presence needs to know if its site or services have suddenly become slow or, even worse, unavailable to end users. Occasionally outages happen, whether it's a bad deployment, a hardware failure, or even something beyond your control. However, knowing within the next few minutes that something's gone wrong gives users more time to respond and get things working again, reducing the impact on their business. Users can specify their own selenium-based scripts to test everyday user flows around their site. Users without coding experience can use a powerful no-code experience to monitor the site in no time (with the same capabilities as any script!). Scripts can be executed on multiple web browsers from various geographic regions. Users can also set up customized alerting rules to automatically and immediately let users know when something doesn't look right.</p>

            <ul>

            <p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Ryan Rules:</strong> I wanted to build a simple-yet-powerful product that any app-owner could use to monitor their app or site for any issues that would impact their users. Whether you'd prefer to write the code or use a no-code experience instead, you can design tests that simulate real-world users with real web-browsers, with immediate alerts when things don't look right that empower teams to resolve any issues quickly. Synthetika was built over the course of 6 months on evenings and weekends by a team of 2 during lockdown so there's likely to be some bugs which we'd love to find and squash! Also - the app is FREE to use entirely while we seek valuable feedback from users that try it out and help us decide where we should take Synthetika next. Happy monitoring!</p>
            <p><strong>Jamie Holmes:</strong> Looks generally well polished! Enjoyed the no-code editor for creating jobs, but would have loved to be able to return and edit the same job in the no-code viewer. Felt slightly jarring when it pushed me into Python. I also would have liked a validator to assert page URL. I wanted to check I'd navigated to the right page and had to do so by page title.</p>
            <p><strong>Ryan Rules:</strong> Hi Jamie, thanks for taking the time to try the app and provide your feedback! At the moment the no-code job-builder is still at an early stage of development and as noted we don't yet have the ability to "save" the no-code visualisation - but for sure we'll take your feedback on as one of the next potential improvements. Thanks for the new validation suggestion - we'll also look to bring this improvement into one of our next updates! Just out of curiosity, would you see yourself primarily using Synthetika to monitor individual pages for availability, or would you want to build more complex jobs mimicking user journeys? Many thanks, Ryan</p>
